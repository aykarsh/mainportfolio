3. **Add Project Images**:
   - Add project screenshots to `images/projects/`
   - Update `Projects.js` with real images

4. **Update Social Links**:
   - Open `src/components/Navbar.js`
   - Update href attributes with your actual social media URLs

5. **Customize Colors** (optional):
   - Edit `tailwind.config.js` to change the color scheme

## How to View Your Portfolio

The development server is already running! Open your browser to:
**http://localhost:3000**

To stop the server: Press `Ctrl+C` in the terminal

To restart the server:
```bash
cd mainportfolio/frontend
npm start
```

## Backend Implementation (Future)

When you're ready to add email functionality:
1. Set up Express server in `backend/`
2. Install nodemailer
3. Create API endpoint for contact form
4. Update `Contact.js` to call the API
5. Configure email service (Gmail, SendGrid, etc.)

## Tips

- All animations are smooth and performant thanks to Framer Motion
- The design is fully responsive - test it on mobile!
- Use the browser dev tools to see how it looks on different screen sizes
- The layout resembles a professional Word document resume but with modern web animations

## Congratulations! 🎊

Your portfolio foundation is complete and running. Now just personalize it with your content!
